His first particular concern was on Consultation with employees, the submission referred to briefing employees and not actual consultation with union representatives (a misunderstanding). Neil provided ConSI-Consultation-PR-01 and Malcolm provided minutes of meeting from the company council which he had email evidence of from Kirsty Garner.\\n\\nA comment was made about a Driving standards audit form used by Neil. Suggestions were made regarding content (which have already been completed). This form was created by Neil but peer reviewed and shared via members of TOMSC which was perceived as very positive.  \\n\\nAssurance plan: he requested sight of the audit plan. He wanted to understand how we define this. I spent some time explaining that we a) have the ability to flex up and down based on business concerns and events. B) have a core group of rail focused modules which we will probably exceed due to the aforementioned point.  I stated the plan is in draft. He specifically wanted to know about professional head input particularly in regards to technical elements. \\nAction: Phil, as discussed previously we need to enhance the draft plan to ensure we are strong enough with technical input. I cannot do this alone and we risk reputational issues if we aren’t looking deep enough into driver standards, plant issues, design issues etc etc. The standard scope doesn’t suffice in this regard, even if we are clear on which audits are being attended by Prof heads and state within the scope section: ‘technical checks as per Professional Head checklists’. Charlie appears to feature regularly, Neil does too. Can we ensure we have the others included:\\nTrack: Graham Barnard,\\nCivils: James Andrews\\nPlant: Justin Davey as well as Neil Whisler\\n\\nAdrian is now happy with the submission. He is keen to visit site onto a train in the near future. He is liaising with Neil on this, likely to be an Amey electrification. \\n\\nSSOWs packs: a discussion about the issue raised (via Airsweb) re the safe systems of work packs and his email re Stockley relates to this via Tony Watkinson. He has concerns packs are generic rather than site specific. Specifically at Stockley the lines are known to have changed names and the packs didn’t reflect this. How familiar are the staff with access points, lines in the area. Reference was made also to previous serious incidents at stockley.
